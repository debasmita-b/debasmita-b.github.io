About me
======
Hello! I'm a third-year PhD student in computer science at Columbia University. I am grateful to be advised by [Professor Julia Hirschberg](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/) as a member of the [Spoken Language Processing Group](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/speech/). I'm broadly interested in multilingual and dialectal natural language processing and computational linguistics. My research so far has applied techniques from computational paralinguistics, discourse analysis, and information theory to better understand how and why speakers code-switch between languages. The goal of my current work is to build more inclusive language technologies by improving the human-like generation of multilingual speech. 

I am also a consulting member of the [ValuesLab](https://valueslab.github.io/) and a technical fellow of Columbia's [AI Alignment Club](https://www.cualignment.org/), where I explore my interest in AI safety. 

Prior to Columbia, I earned my BSc and MEng at Cornell University, where I majored in computer science and minored in linguistics. At Cornell, I was fortunate to work with [Professor Thomas Davidson](https://www.thomasrdavidson.com/) and [Professor Marten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/) on projects evaluating the [dialectal](https://aclanthology.org/W19-3504/) [bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13041) and [syntactic capabilities](https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.39/) of language models.

As of Fall 2022, I am a [Croucher Scholar](https://scholars.croucher.org.hk/). My graduate work is supported by an NSF EAGER Award (2023-2024) and an NSF Small Grant (2024-2027).
