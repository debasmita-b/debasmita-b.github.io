I have had several opportunities to teach at Columbia during my PhD studies.


Advanced Topics in Spoken Language Processing
======

In Spring 2023 and 2024, and Fall 2024, I served as Head Teaching Assistant for Advanced Topics in Spoken Language Processing (COMS 6998/6706). Across all three semesters of teaching, I designed and tested one-third of the courseâ€™s programming assignments, and graded these as well as weekly written assignments. I hosted weekly office hours for 85+ students, explaining how to debug parselmouth errors, extract OpenSmile features, navigate the command line, and analyze classifier predictions. I also developed an FAQ guide for students seeking help with using Praat. 

In Spring and Fall 2024 and 2025, I gave a guest lecture on speech analysis, with a focus on the paralinguistics of code-switching.

In Fall 2025, I am an instructor of record for the class, delivering the first five weeks of conceptual lecture content.
